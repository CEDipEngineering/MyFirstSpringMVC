# MyFirstCRUD
Java CRUD example, made in eclipse, using Tomcat-api and MySQL

## How to use:
In Eclipse, you will need to point to your servlet-api and tomcat directories, so that no more servlet not found errors appear.

Then you will need to change your MySQL credentials in order to be able to access your MySQL Databases.

Then you will need to create a database in mysql according to the script in SQL-Gen.txt.

After that, I recommend running the server in Eclipse, but accessing the loclahost:8080 address it displays on your preferred browser, as Eclipse's broswer does not properly support the embedded css.
